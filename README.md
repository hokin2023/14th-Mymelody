# Description

- A blog app that allows users to post, comment, edit, and interact with other users.

- This app helped me sharpen my skills needed for project 2.

- Many challenges and problems were solved such as getting the API to work, Javascript files, and handlebars.

- I feel motivated at the end because it brought me one step closer to success.
